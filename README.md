# Math Practice Problem Generator
This is a simple Python program that generates random math problems by importing the random library to help users practice basic arithmetic. The program selects random numbers and asks the user to solve addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division problems. It provides encouraging messages for correct answers and supportive retries for incorrect answers.

This is a first semester project that showcases core Python concepts such as loops, functions, input handling, conditionals, and randomization. It is interactive and replayable, making it useful for mental math and learning.

The program allows you to choose:
- The type of math operation the user wants to practice
- The difficulty level 
- And whether to practice a single category or all arithmetic categories


##  Features
- Randomly generated new math problems every time
- Multiple operation modes:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication 
  - Division 
  - Mixed Mode (includes all arithmetic)
- Encouraging feedback messages for correct answers
- Helpful retry messages for incorrect answers
- Continuous problem flow until the user wants to exit
  

## Improvements for the Future
- Interactive GUI version using tkinter
- Score tracking / timed quiz mode
- Progress reports or performance analytics
